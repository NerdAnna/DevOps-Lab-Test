To make a cluster of 3 ElasticSearch nodes on AWS, you can use the following steps:



1. Create an EC2 security group that allows incoming traffic on port 9300 for communication between ElasticSearch nodes and port 9200 for communication with clients.

2. Launch 3 EC2 instances with the Amazon Linux 2 AMI and associate the security group created in step 1 to each instance.

3. On each EC2 instance, install Java and ElasticSearch as described in the previous answer.

4. On each EC2 instance, edit the ElasticSearch configuration file elasticsearch.yml and set the following parameters:

cluster.name: my_cluster_name # Replace with your desired cluster name
node.name: node1 # Replace with node1, node2, and node3 for each instance respectively
network.host: 0.0.0.0
discovery.seed_hosts: ["node1_private_ip", "node2_private_ip", "node3_private_ip"] # Replace with the private IPs of each instance
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true


On each EC2 instance, start the ElasticSearch service using the following command:
sudo /usr/local/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch



Verify that the cluster has formed correctly by sending a GET request to the endpoint 
http://node1_private_ip:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
and checking that the cluster status is green.

You can now access the ElasticSearch cluster by sending requests to any of the node IP addresses. You will need to provide credentials for access.
