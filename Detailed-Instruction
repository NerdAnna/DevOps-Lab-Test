3.	Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), such as Amazon Linux 2, and select it.
4.	Choose an instance type, such as t2.micro, and select it.
5.	Configure the instance details as desired.
6.	Add storage as needed.
7.	Add tags as desired.
8.	Choose the security group that you created, or create a new one.
9.	Review and launch the instance.
10.	Select the key pair that you created, or create a new one.
11.	Launch the instance.


# Installing and Configuring ElasticSearch
1.	Connect to the instance using SSH.
2.	Install Java:

sudo yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk


3.    Download and extract ElasticSearch:
bash
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf elasticsearch-7.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv elasticsearch-7.7.0 /usr/local/elasticsearch


4.	Set up the ElasticSearch configuration file:
sudo nano /usr/local/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml

# In the configuration file, add the following content:

cluster.name: my_cluster_name
node.name: node1
network.host: 0.0.0.0
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true


5.	Start the ElasticSearch service:
sudo /usr/local/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch


# Verifying ElasticSearch Functionality
1.	Verify that the ElasticSearch service is running:
curl localhost:9200 

# You should see a JSON response indicating that ElasticSearch is running.
2.    Verify that ElasticSearch requires credentials:

curl https://localhost:9200 
You should see a response indicating that authentication is required.


#Conclusion
With these steps, you have successfully launched an AWS instance,
installed and configured ElasticSearch, 
and verified that it is functioning.
You can now use the instance to run your ElasticSearch workloads.
